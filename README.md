**Lung Cancer Diagnosis Algorithm in Patients with Isolated Pulmonary Nodules in Computed Tomography image of the Chest Using Deep Learning**

\ | Details
 :-: | :-----:
 **Abstract** | Deep neural network to detect isolated nodules, which classify whether nodule is cancer or not from chest CT(computed tomography) images. In this project, deep neural network is based on CNN including Deconvolution layers and unpooling layers for classification and segmentation.
